						<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/universalcreative/" target="_blank">Universal Creative</a> designs, develops, and delivers themed attractions, rides, resorts, and parks globally for Universal Parks & Resorts, a division of NBCUniversal, whose parent company is Comcast. Its divisions include master planning, creative development, design, engineering, project management, and research and development.</p>

						<h3>ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY INTERACTIVES (ATI)</h3>

						<p>I am currently an <strong>Associate Designer</strong> with Universal Creative Core's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/universalcreative_we-innovate-like-its-our-job-because-it-activity-6564968598392098820-A2h6/" target="_blank">ATI Team</a> based in Orlando, Florida.  I began my career with ATI as an intern back in Sept 2016.</p>

						<p>ATI works to create platforms and products for immersive experiences across Universal Parks & Resorts. I've had the pleasure of working with several Project Teams such as the Super Nintendo World™ Team, the Universal's Epic Universe Team, Universal Creative Core internal functions, and more to design immersive experiences.</p>

						<img src="assets/images/UniversalCreative/ati-team.jpeg" alt="">

						<h3>UX/UI DESIGN</h3>

						<p>I design the UX, UI, and interactions for several internal tools used to test and adjust interactive experiences. These tools are developed for making live changes to the interactive experiences while they are being designed, before performing official user testing.</p>

						<div align="center">
							<img src="assets/images/UniversalCreative/testtoolsui.png" width="400" alt="">
						</div>

						<p>I collaborate with designers, engineers, and developers on identifying their needs, streamline the information, and at times theme the tool to paricular intellectual properties. Having a user friendly tool allows for easier training to more Team Members and consistent demonstrations of the interactive experience.</p>

						<h3>BRANDING AND INFORMATION DESIGN</h3>

						<p>I designed the brand identity for the ATI team which included a brand style guide, Microsoft Office and Keynote templates, report structures and other visual representations as resources for the team to use during presentations, showcases, and general work documentation. Some of my custom presentation designs were used to present theme park proposals and financial updates to various IP-holders and to senior leadership at the company.</p>

						<p>My work on the ATI brand identity was one of the precursors to the establishment of the Universal Creative Communications and Brand Management Team.</p>

						<p>Pictured below are some of the initial branding elements I created for the ATI Team displayed at our office.</p>

						<img src="assets/images/UniversalCreative/branding-ati.jpeg" alt="">

						<h3>PROJECT MANAGEMENT</h3>

						<p>I led the development of 2 internal proof of concepts. One of projects was a digital simulation to visualize and interact with an experience before it passed onto larger scale mock ups. The second was an interactive merchandise proposal which began as a side passion project and was later approved to be further investigated. I made the pitch to a Project Team which is now considering the product in a future development.</p>

						<p>Pictured below is one of my past interns beginning to assemble an interactive prototype using the Teensy microcontroller.</p>

						<img src="assets/images/UniversalCreative/prototyping-ati.jpeg" alt="">

						<p>I have also assisted in some of the contracting processes for hiring and managing vendors for the development and integration of new projects.</p>

						<h3>MANAGING COOL TECH</h3>

						<p>I am a co-founder and manager of the ATI Lab & Maker Space. The Lab is home to shared equipment and working space used for building prototypes such as 3D printers, electronics, and other cool equipment. As a manager, I help to ensure all lab users adhere to safety guidelines, receive necessary training, and have the tools or materials they need to perform their work.</p>

						<h4>COVID-19 Effort</h4>

						<p>I had the priviledge of being able to take one of our office 3D printers home during the COVID-19 pandemic to help print face shields and ear savers to donate to our local healthcare workers in Orlando, FL. I was also one of the key coordinators for our Universal Orlando Resort Effort.</p>
