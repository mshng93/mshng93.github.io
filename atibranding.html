                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>The Advanced Technology & Interactives (ATI) Team was a multi-faceted group within Universal Creative (UC) formed in late 2015. The core team was small with the majority of its members deployed to various projects. I was presented with the task to <strong>create a presentation title slide and footer</strong> that could be used by any ATI Team Member when presenting their work to show the cohesiveness of our group despite the number of dispatched members.</p>

                      <h3>A Lasting Reputation</h3>
                      <p>Yes, I created that presentation title slide - and my work on those assets were so well received that it made me strive to grow the resources into an overall visual brand for the team. I expanded the library of assets and templates to the point where other team members felt comfortable using them and followed the style guidelines. This elevated ATI's reputation within the company as we gained more exposure with key personnel for our projects.</p>

                <h3>Understanding The Vision</h3>

                <p>I worked closely with the team's Creative Director to grasp what his vision was for the team. This helped me to form a general look and feel. I created several <strong>iterations of layouts and color combinations</strong> before beginning on the initial slide design. I used the chosen version to refine the assets that formed the template of various presentation platforms such as PowerPoint and Keynote.</p>

                <p>This is a higher level look at the process of creating the title slide, taking both elements of our team name and inspiration from "technology" patterns.</p>

                <h3>The Templates and Assets</h3>

                <p>I followed up on the success of my inital title slide design by producing the following <strong>additional team-branded templates</strong> as well as a <strong>branding guideline booklet</strong> for others to reference.</p>

                <h3>Design Done Well Will Be Used</h3>

                <p>After creating the ecosystem of essential templates, I also custom designed assets for formal demonstrations of our team's work. These assets included <strong>description signage, email invites, presentations, notices, and more</strong>. We sometimes accommodate over 100 Team Members through a demonstration depending on the size and number of demos that are being showcased or user tested.</p>

                <p>My work on the ATI brand was so well received and accessible that other teammates who weren't necessarily designers were able to easily <strong>use my assets to create their own products when needed</strong>. Some of these products included stickers, thank you cards, and custom story cards made for a 2017 SXSW experience with Sony.</p>

                <p>My brand design expertise was drawn upon more specifically to create <strong>custom presentations</strong> for ATI leadership to present to Universal Creative stakeholders. These presentations ranged from <strong>project updates, financial planning, and more</strong>. Depending on the use case, I would sometime also create <strong>custom infographics</strong> in order to best portray the information being communicated.</p>

                <h3>Growth of Branding within Universal Creative</h3>

                <p>I learned that <strong>empowering my team</strong> with these branding tools was a success in itself. As each team member was educated on the brand, they could reinforce our team message with each of their own individual products without the bottleneck of going through myself as the team's brand lead.</p>

                <p>My work, along with a some other branding pioneers at Universal Creative, became <strong>part of a larger initiative for reimagining Universal Creative's overall brand</strong>. A year after I entered the company, I got to witness Universal Creative form it's own Branding and Communications's team and was lucky enough to <strong>participate in an early consultation panel</strong> while the group was developing how to communicate Universal Creative to the world.</p>

                <h3>Aligning ATI to Universal Creative</h3>

                <p>By the time Universal Creative's brand was established, the majority of ATI was already grandfathered into using my original templates. However, as a team within Universal Creative, the <strong>discrepancy between the two brands had the ability to create confusion in the future</strong>. I engaged with the Brand and Communication's team to collaborate on <strong>updating ATI's existing templates to adopt the Universal Creative style guide</strong>.</p>

                <p>Since the UC brand was still young, it did not yet have every asset that ATI was already using. I managed to recreate most of our existing documentation to follow the UC brand while gaining approval on particular aspects that could still help ATI differentiate themselves from other groups within the company.</p>
