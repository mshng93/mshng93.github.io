                <h3>What Is A Family Waiting Room?</h3>

                <p>Besides seating and movie clips on loop, <strong>Family Waiting Rooms (also known as Child Swap Rooms) do not have much else to offer</strong> for those who most frequently occupy this space. They're pretty boring.</p>

                <p>An attraction <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/plan-your-visit/hours-information/childcare-services" target="_blank">Family Waiting Room</a> is a place for <strong>guests with small children</strong>, or <strong>anyone who cannot/does not want to ride</strong>, where one member of your party can wait with the little ones while the rest of your party rides. Once the main party finished riding, they may switch places so whoever rode can stay with the kids, and the adult(s) who sat out can then enjoy the ride.</p>

                      <p>The interactive team created 3 vehicle-themed childrens tablet minigames in parallel with the primary project team that implemented the racing slot cars. The minigames (or potentially just the tablets...) were played with often enough; let say we had to replace the iPads more than once. The games in the Fast & Furious: Supercharged Childswap Room are the first of its kind to be implemented at Universal Orlando Resort™.</p>

                <h3>Goal: Make The Waiting Room Fun</h3>
                <p>Guest Satisfaction (GSATs) is a system used to rate the success of our attractions and the theme park. Of the top 3 qualitative guest-voiced requests desired for the theme park, Family Rooms already succeeds in 2 categories - <strong>providing seating and air conditioning</strong>. The final request for <strong>'more immersive environments'</strong> was the driving factor for this team when tasked to create a more fun and story-centric Family Waiting Room.</p>

                <h3>Goal: Make The Fun Easy To Access</h3>

                <p>We chose to <strong>create minigames</strong> due to their <strong>low barrier of entry and small learning curve</strong> because when guests reach the Family Waiting Room, they may have already been standing for 30+ minutes, potentially in high heat and humidity. Rides also have a relatively quick turn-around time, >10 minutes.</p>

                <h3>Selecting 3 Games For The Product</h3>

                <p>3 concepts were selected for the final product: <strong>Tile Matching, Puzzle, and Coloring Book</strong>. Initially, a Simon Says game was also accepted but we eventually vetoed it in favor of polishing the other concepts due to schedule and budget constraints.</p>

                <p>To arrive at our final concepts, we conducted preliminary research on tablet games and brainstormed ideas. We grouped similar categories, ranked them according to trends within the targeted 3-5 year old age range, and parsed down to the final game concepts.</p>

                <p>Details of each game were written out into a game design document and reviewed before entering production.</p>

                <p>The Family Waiting Room is a very small part of the larger attraction that the Guest Satisfaction Surveys do not typically gather statistics for. As we create the platform for similar games in the future, I intend to include in the development (if possible) the ability to add tags for data tracking without the need to consult external user research groups after a product is live.</p>

                <h3>Expansion to Other Attractions</h3>
                <p>Family Waiting Rooms can be overlooked or rank low in priority when a project team designs an attraction. I was delighted to join this project in particular to <strong>advocate a more inclusive experience</strong> for those who may not have the ability to access particular attractions.</p>

                <p>The minigames were developed with a framework and documented for <strong>expanding the platform future Family Waiting Rooms</strong>. I have already worked with attraction design teams who now design with more consideration for this space.</p>
