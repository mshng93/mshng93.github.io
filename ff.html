              <h2 class="title">Challenge</h2>

                <p>If you do not ride an attraction, you miss out on a lot. How can we make a ride's <a href="#context">Family Room</a> more inclusive, fun, and immersive so <strong>guests who cannot or do not ride can also enjoy the attraction?</strong></p>

                <h2 class="title">Solution</h2>

                <p>Create a space <strong>targeted specifically for Family Room users</strong> through implementing <strong>themed physical and digital game options</strong> usable by a large demographic.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Impact</h2>

                <p>We created the first Family Room of its kind with built-in games! <strong>Family Room users can experience a unique aspect of the attraction</strong> to share with the rest of their theme park group without having ridden the ride. The design team <strong>inspired other Ride Designers to increase their consideration of the Family Room</strong> for future attractions to be more inclusive for all guests.</p>

                <p>An attraction's <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/plan-your-visit/hours-information/childcare-services" target="_blank">Family Room</a> is a waiting room for <strong>guests with small children</strong>, or <strong>anyone who cannot/does not want to ride</strong>, where one member of your party can wait with the little ones while the rest of your party rides. Once the main party finished riding, they may switch places so whoever rode can stay with the kids, and the adult(s) who sat out can then enjoy the ride.</p>

                <h2 class="title">1. Address Immersive Environment Survey Rating</h2>
                <p>The Park's consumer insights research group provided our team with the top guest-voiced requests for the theme park. Family Rooms already succeeds in the top 2 categories. The third request for <strong>"more immersive and themed environments"</strong> was the driving factor for taking a deeper dive into the design of the Family Room as the least themed area of the ride.</p>

                <h2 class="title">2. Maintain a Low Barrier of Entry To Play</h2>

                <p>By the time guests reach the Family Room, they may have already been standing for 30+ minutes, potentially in high heat and humidity. So, our design needed to eliminate any additional frictions for the guest to get to the experience.</p>

                <h2 class="title">3. Align vertically to story</h2>

                <p>What guests see in the Family Room should resemble what guests see when they ride the attraction so that both parties can relate to the same story.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Observation-Focused</h2>
                <p>As informed by our company Consumer Insights group, there isn't much formally collected data on Family Rooms because they are such a small feature in the theme parks. So, my team and I decided to perform internal research to better inform our design decisions.</p>
                
                <p>In compliance with company regulations, we were not able to speak directly with guests and relied predominantly on observational notes.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Data Collection</h2>
                <p>We collected data from various Family Rooms across Universal Orlando Resort over the course of a week during different times of the day. Due to the project schedule, a set number of Family Rooms were assesed.</p>

                <p class="img-caption" align="center">Various Universal Orlando Resort Family Rooms.</p>

                <p>Both observable qualitative and quantitative data was collected such as number of occupants, estimated age range of the occupants, and what activies each individual was doing while in the Family Room.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Deriving Insights</h2>
                <p>Although the data was limited, conducting the research helped our team to reinforce our decisions. Here is a snapshot of our key takeaways specifically to inform the product's design:</p>

                <p>The team brainstormed various toddler-aged tablet games as a blue sky activity. We drew inspiration from existing games on the market. Once the concepts were on the table, we grouped together similar games and ranked them for fun, feasible, and works well in theme with Fast & Furious.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Game Selection</h2>

                <p>3 concepts were selected for the final product which closely aligned to the existing products were were seeing: <strong>Tile Matching, Puzzle, and Coloring Book</strong>. Initially, a Simon Says game was also accepted but we eventually vetoed it in favor of polishing the other concepts due to schedule and budget constraints.</p>

                <p>Details of each game were written out into a game design document and reviewed before entering production.</p>

                <p>I drew different iterations of the games UX flow. I re-worked the UI so that a single tap from the main menu enters the selected experience to reduce interactions and streamline the UX architecture.</p>

                <p>I leveraged iconography and animations to communicate each experience while using minimal text. Larger element sizes helped to limit errors choosing which game to play, especially if the user is a child. We used approved Fast & Furious imagery to adhere to the storytelling of the attraction.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Coloring Game</h3>

                <p>Designing the color picker was fun to brainstorm, but the team decided that crayons would be both a fun and intuitive way to show, especially for toddlers, which color they were using. My early sketches that included scrolling, dragging, and other interactions either had too many steps or additional edge cases that could contirbute towards cognitive overload and were omitted.</p>

                <p class="img-caption" align="center">UI Sketches for color picker: simple tap, scroll bar, color picker bar, color dragging and more.</p>

                <p>The final design was 2 steps: tap your crayon, tap an area to color.</p>

                <br>

                <p>One of the challenges I had when working with the coloring game was that we were constrained to use assets provided by the Fast & Furious intellectual property which had very detailed outlines. These more detailed areas were tough to fill with color via tap. Here are some of the design decisions I made to increase this game's usability.</p>

                <br><br>

                <p>1. Tapping an area filled in that section with highlited color</p>
                <p>2. Active color is highlighted, previously the active crayon would be elevated compared to the rest but traded off for a larger image display area</p>
                <p>3. High detail areas were reworked so that they could still be colored with ease and left no white space unable to be colored</p>
                <p>4. Undo button undid the last interaction performed, colors could also be overridden by selecting a different color and tapping the same area</p>
                <p>5. Back button to the main menu, upon return to the same game the game will be reset</p>

                <p>The Family Room is a very small feature that our Park's Guest Satisfaction (GSAT) Surveys do not gather statistics for. Although we were able to visibly improve this Family Room in comparison to others, we primarily used this project as <strong>an opportunity to advocate inclusion for the measurements to be taken into account</strong> for GSATs.</p>

                <p><strong>In-game statistics were not built in.</strong> If the development schedules allows, I would have developers include feature tracking tags in the software to provide key performance indicators such as time spent on a game to advise on future feature development. <strong>This was a great learning opportunity.</strong></p>

                <p>Family Rooms can be overlooked or rank low in priority when a project team designs an attraction. I was delighted to join this project in particular may not have the ability to acc to <strong>advocate a more inclusive experience</strong> for those whoess particular attractions.</p>

                <p>The minigames were developed with a framework and documented for <strong>expanding the platform future Family Rooms</strong>. I have already worked with attraction design teams who now design with more consideration for this space.</p>
