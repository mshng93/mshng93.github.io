                <p>An attraction's <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/plan-your-visit/hours-information/childcare-services" target="_blank">Family Waiting Room</a> is a place for <strong>guests with small children</strong>, or <strong>anyone who cannot/does not want to ride</strong>, where one member of your party can wait with the little ones while the rest of your party rides. Once the main party finished riding, they may switch places so whoever rode can stay with the kids, and the adult(s) who sat out can then enjoy the ride.</p>

                <p>Besides seating and movie clips on loop,Family Waiting Rooms (also known as Child Swap Rooms) do not have much else to offer to those who most frequently occupy this space. <strong>They're pretty boring.</strong></p>

                <h2 class="title">1. Increase Immersive Environment GSAT Rating</h2>
                <p>Guest Satisfaction (GSATs) is a system used to rate the success of our attractions and the theme park. Of the top 3 qualitative guest-voiced requests desired for the theme park, Family Rooms already succeeds in 2 categories - <strong>providing seating and air conditioning</strong>. The final request for <strong>'more immersive environments'</strong> was the driving factor for this team when tasked to create a more fun and story-centric Family Waiting Room.</p>

                <p>Why can't the Family Room be as immersive as the attraction itself?</p>

                <h2 class="title">2. Maintain a Low Barrier of Entry To Play</h2>

                <p>We were constrained to designing for tablets, so we chose to <strong>create minigames</strong> due to their <strong>low barrier of entry and small learning curve</strong>.By the time guests reach the Family Waiting Room, they may have already been standing for 30+ minutes, potentially in high heat and humidity. Rides also have a relatively quick turn-around time, >10 minutes so we want to make sure the experience makes sense for that timeframe.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Observation-Focused</h2>
                <p>The Family Waiting Room is a relatively smaller feature within the larger theme park, so there was little research performed on the rooms from our dedicated Research Team. My team and I decided to perform some internal research to better inform our design decisions. In compliance with company regulations, we were not able to speak directly with guests and relied predominantly on observation.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Data Collection</h2>
                <p>My teammates and I visited the various Family Waiting Rooms across Universal Orlando Resort over the course of a week during different times of the day. We chose a few attractions as constants we would revisit multiple times, some were the park's mostly highly rated attractions while others were the lowest rated. We also compared the kids zone attractions compared to the more thrilling rides.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Clarifying The Audience</h2>
                <p>Through our research, insights were collected that helped to reinforce some of the ideas the team had for our designs. Most of them were predictable, but nonetheless helpful to reinforce our beliefs. Here is a snapshot of our key takeaways:</p>
                <li>Distribution of children/teens to adults are pretty even across the Family Rooms</li>
                <li>Highly rated rides had significantly more Family Room users</li>
                <li>Most teens and adults are on their mobile phones in the room</li>
                <li>Highly occupied Family Rooms are very loud and noisy both due to occupancy and the attraction</li>
                <li>Seats are taken up if available</li>

                <h2 class="title">Brainstorm</h2>
                <p>The team brainstormed various tablet games as a blue sky activity. We drew inspiration from existing games on the market. Once the concepts were on the table, we grouped together similar games and ranked them for fun, feasible, and works well in theme with Fast & Furious.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Game Selection</h2>

                <p>3 concepts were selected for the final product: <strong>Tile Matching, Puzzle, and Coloring Book</strong>. Initially, a Simon Says game was also accepted but we eventually vetoed it in favor of polishing the other concepts due to schedule and budget constraints.</p>

                <p>Details of each game were written out into a game design document and reviewed before entering production.</p>

                <p>I drew different iterations of the user flow through the game with different UI layouts. To streamline the game so we could work towards the goal of a lower barrier of entry to play, I re-worked the UI so that a single tap from the main menu enters the selected experience.</p>

                <p>I leveraged iconography and animations to communicate each experience while using minimal text. Larger element sizes helped to limit errors choosing which game to play, especially if the user is a child. We used approved Fast & Furious imagery to adhere to the storytelling of the attraction.</p>

                <p>1. Tapping an area filled in that section with highlited color</p>
                <p>2. Active color is highlighted, previously the active crayon would be elevated compared to the rest but traded off for a larger image display area</p>
                <p>3. High detail areas were reworked so that they could still be colored with ease and left no white space unable to be colored</p>
                <p>4. Undo button undid the last interaction performed, colors could also be overridden by selecting a different color and tapping the same area</p>
                <p>5. Back button to the main menu, upon return to the same game the game will be reset</p>

                <p>The Fast & Furious: Supercharged ride opened about a year after developing the games, but my teammate and I were lucky enough to get to install the tablet into its final casing.</p>

                <h2 class="title">A Learning Opportunity</h2>
                <p>The Family Waiting Room is a very small part of the larger attraction that the Guest Satisfaction Surveys do not typically gather statistics for. Although we were able to visibly improve this Family Waiting Room in comparison to others, we still strive to advocate for the measurements to be taken into account for GSATs.</p>

                <p>As we create the platform for similar games in the future, I intend to include in the development (if possible) the ability to add tags for data tracking without the need to consult external user research groups after a product is live. This data can help inform us about the game's performance and provide insights for future designs.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Expansion to Other Attractions</h2>
                <p>Family Waiting Rooms can be overlooked or rank low in priority when a project team designs an attraction. I was delighted to join this project in particular to <strong>advocate a more inclusive experience</strong> for those who may not have the ability to access particular attractions.</p>

                <p>The minigames were developed with a framework and documented for <strong>expanding the platform future Family Waiting Rooms</strong>. I have already worked with attraction design teams who now design with more consideration for this space.</p>
