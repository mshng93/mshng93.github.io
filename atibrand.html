						<h3>BRIEF</h3>

						<p>The Advanced Technology & Interactives (ATI) Team was a small, multi-faceted group with most of its members physically deployed to various projects. How do we create consistent messaging when presenting our work to key stakeholders?</p>

						<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

						<p>The sole goal presented to me was to create a presentation title slide that could be used by any ATI Team Member when presenting their work. My process and work on this initial asset was well received and grew into a larger overall visual brand for the team. My work on the ATI brand can be considered one of the precursors to the creation of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/universalcreative/">Universal Creative</a>'s Branding and Communications team.</p>

						<hr>

						<h3>PRODUCT</h3>

						<p>I produced the following team-branded templates and assets.</p>

						<img src="assets/images/UniversalCreative/platforms.png" alt="">

						<li>Microsoft Powerpoint Assets and Theme (Master Slides)</li>
						<li>Microsoft Word Cover Page and Theme</li>
						<li>Keynote Theme (Master Slides)</li>
						<li>Custom posters</li>
						<li>Internal TV "ads" around the office</li>
						<li>Event signage</li>

						<h3>DESIGN</h3>

						<p>ATI predominantly uses presentations to showcase technologies that the team discovers or develops to gain approvals or funding to implement them in the theme park. Thus, I worked first on making the presentation title page and other presentation-related assets including the footer.</p>

						<p>I worked closely with our Creative Director to understand what the <strong>general look and feel</strong> should be like. I created several <strong>iterations of assets and color combinations</strong> before beginning on the actual slide design. This process lent itself nicely to when I finally created the images that would eventually be folded into the themes of various presentation platforms such as PowerPoint and Keynote.</p>

						<img src="assets/images/UniversalCreative/atibrandprocess.png" alt="">

						<p>This is a higher level look at the process of creating the title slide, taking both elements of our team name and inspiration from "technology" patterns.</p>

						<h3>USE CASES</h3>

						<p>I also created many assets for <strong>various showcases</strong> of our team's work when it is better to demonstrate a prototype or technology to Team Members in person. These assets included <strong>description signage, email invites, presentations, notices, and more</strong>. We sometimes bring in over 100 total Team Members depending on what or how many projects are being showcased or user tested.</p>

						<p>I often made <strong>custom presentations</strong> for ATI leadership to present to Universal Creative stakeholders. These presentations ranged from <strong>project updates, financial planning, and more</strong>. Depending on the use case, I would sometime also create <strong>custom infographics</strong> in order to best portray the information being communicated.

						<h3>BRANDING GROWTH</h3>

						<p>My work, along with a few other branding pioneers at Universal Creative, became <strong>part of a larger initiative for reimagining Universal Creative's overall brand</strong>. A year after I entered the company, I got to witness Universal Creative form it's own Branding and Communications's team and was lucky enough to <strong>take part in an early consultation panel</strong> while the group was developing how to communicate Universal Creative to the world.</p>

						<hr>

						<h3>REFLECTION</h3>

						<p>Until I began my career at Universal, I viewed branding mainly as a tool used for marketing: a very external, business-to-consumer mindset. I learned after seeing the results of what I created that <strong>the power of branding could be applied internal to a company</strong> as well and can help your team be more <strong>well-recognized and grow</strong>. Despite being a young team, many Team Members within Universal Creative started learning about ATI. The work we produced was recognized and understood by senior leadership. The ATI team tripled in size over the next 3 years.</p>
